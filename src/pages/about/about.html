   <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <h4>Gary Mannion -- G00319609 -- GMIT</h4>

<p>This is my 3rd Year final project for software development. For my project I have decided to make a web application for a travel planning guide that will allow a user to enter details about their travel destination such as flights, hotel, transfers and also an itinerary for different attractions that they wish to visit on their trip.

The project was guided by the following extract from the project instructions:

You are required to develop a application written in the preferred programming language of your Choice. You must devise an idea for a application. Write the software. Write documentation explaining how the application works. Write a short user guide for it.

The application will be made using the ionic framework and the google Fire-base as my database.</p>
